# Matlab implementation

This folder contains the matlab files for the numerical experiment.

## Content

1. The 'src' folder contains source files to the experiment, it includes the data generation files plus all files to construct and solve the optimization model.

2. The 'Main' folder contains run files to generate the experiment results.

3. The 'results' folder contains .mat files which are the statistics obtained from the numerical experiments used for the plots in the paper. The file containing the full numerical results is too big, and thus is available upon request.

## Requirement

1. Matlab (the experiment has been run on Matlab 2018a).

2. YALMIP (free of charge, downloadable from https://yalmip.github.io/).

3. Gurobi (free for academic purpose, Gurobi 8.0 has used for experiment).
